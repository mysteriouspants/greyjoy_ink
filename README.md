# Greyjoy Ink

Greyjoy Ink is based on the Octopress 2 theme by Reza Jatnika. It has
been seriously cut-down, with the stuff I didn't want removed (Disqus,
FaceTwitPlus sharing bollocks, etc) eviscerated to create what I feel is
a lovely minimalist blog theme.

*Features!*

* Super-minimalist
* Justified & hypenated content
* MathJax
